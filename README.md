# Poland---Block-2-HTML-CSS---Part-1-
My first 2-column webpage
And by: first 2-column webpage I also mean: the 2nd webpage I've ever made.

In this project, I learned:
- how to make a navigation panel for a website
- how to create a simple, 2-column layout
- how to put an image in the header
- how to put a logo on the image
- how to add social media buttons
- how to style links

In hindsight, I could've chosen a less brown colour scheme ;)
